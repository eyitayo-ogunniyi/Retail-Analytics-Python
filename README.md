# Retail Analytics in Python

In this project, I analysed Chips transactional and customer data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviors. 
The insights from this analysis will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.
The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior.

I carried out processes like:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning with Pandas
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Data Analysis

Lastly, I presented a strategic recommendation that is supported by data. My analysis and recommendations are documented in this [notebook](https://github.com/eyitayo22/Retail-Analytics-Python/blob/main/Retail%20Analytics.ipynb).
